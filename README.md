How Social Are Ya? The Game!

A JavaScript text- and image-based adventure game where users are prompted on
how to behave in different social scenarios, including being at parties, going to
live events, purchasing goods at a store, scheduling and interacting with service
people, etc.

You will being by answering a few questions, which will then be placed into a function that
will spit out a variable scenario based on whatever the values supplied are. For example, 
if I ask: A/S/L and you answer 25/Male/New York, I would put you at a release party for an
author/musician, and then from there I would supply the prompts, and the subsequent answer
choices based, which will lead to differing prompts and answer choices based on prior 
selections.

The game will be mostly javascript/html/css, with images suppled based on each situation, mostly
Reaction Shot pics from Mike Legg, followed by pictures from either the setting or the person
who is being interacted with. More characters will be supplied as we go further into the season...

And by the end of the game, players will be ranked on how social they are, with descriptions for each level of 
sociability (ranges from ashamed hamster to angry wolf, or something like that)

Model:

You're in the bathroom with three other people you don't know. One of them is looking right at you, literally
starting you in the eyes and eating an apple with both hands. The other two are making out with a ham sandwich
sandwiched between their mouths. What would you do?
A: Join the ham sandwich kiss sandwich.
B: Ask the apple eater for a bite.
C: Do your business, wash your hands, get out of there without a word.
D: Ask everyone for their email addresses.
